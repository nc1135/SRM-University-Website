            <p>SRMIST's engineering programs endeavor to be at the forefront of innovation. They also foster multi-disciplinary
            collaborations aimed at solving the most pressing global problems.
            
            Our mission is to seek solutions to global challenges by using the power of engineering principles, techniques and
            systems. We believe that engineers should not only possess deep technical excellence, but also nurture creativity,
            cultural awareness and entrepreneurial skills that come from exposure to science, business, medicine and other
            disciplines - all integral part of the SRM experience.
            
            Our goal is to deliver world class, solutions driven programs that inspire curiosity and generate new knowledge and
            discoveries. Our collaboration with over 50 of the world's best universities and 215 corporates, strengthens our
            academic and research programs.</p>
